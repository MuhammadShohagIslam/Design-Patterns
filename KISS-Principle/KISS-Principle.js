    *** KISS Principles ***
        => KISS means Keep It Simple Stupid. It does not mean that you
        are studpid. You are very smart and beautiful.
        => It means that our code should be studpidly simple. It should be so simple, everybody should understand what the system does and grasp quickly as possible a good mental model of it.
        => It should be so simple that when we will quit our company, a
        junior developer should be able to continue our masterpiece.

        *** Simple ***
            => A Simple system is not a system with one and only one
            element necessarily. It's system which has not too many
            different elements connected to each other.
        
        *** To summarize, here are the two sign of complexity:
            => Too many parts in the system.
            => Too many interconnected part in the system.

        *** Business Complexity ***
            => The complexity of a system will also be a good indicator
            of the amount of time developers need to add a new functionality.

            *** As a developer, we need to keep the flowing in mind.
            
                => If we can avoid complexity, avoid it, as much as we can.
                => If we can not, we need to make sure that we manage it properly.
                => To avoid as much buiness complexity as possibile, i 
                suggest at tacking the complexity of the buiness requirement directly.

        *** A good implemetation is Deleted One ***

            => Less code will often make our system simpler. Big is often synoym with complexity.
            => Intead, changing our code can have an impact on the surrounding code and create undesired results.
            => Simplifying our codebase by removing dead code will simplify our mental models.
